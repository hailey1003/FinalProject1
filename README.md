# Goal: Predict the housing price of each home in Ames, Iowa by utilizing the 79 unique explanatory variables

For this project I utilized 12 different methods in order to accuractely predict the housing price. These methods were:

                                     Kth Nearest Neighbor
                                     
                                     Linear Regression
                                     
                                     Shrinkage - Ridge
                                     
                                     Shrinkage - Lasso
                                     
                                     Subset Selection - Best
                                     
                                     Subset Selection - Forward
                                     
                                     Subset Selection - Backward
                                     
                                     Generalized Additive Models
                                     
                                     Regression Trees
                                     
                                     Bagging
                                     
                                     Random Forest
                                     
                                     Boosting

After submitting all predicitons to Kaggle, the Boosting model performed the best with only a .14893 error rate in Kaggle, and the Linear Regression model performed the worst with a .60538 error rate in Kaggle.

For quite a few of the models, the most significant predictors that were consistently significant included OverallQual, X1stFlrSF, and X2ndFlrSF.
